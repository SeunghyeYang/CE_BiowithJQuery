              <p>I believe that designers have social responsibility. This is because the result of designer influences society in any way, whether small or large. I want to be a designer who tries his best to make sure that the results of the design I create have a positive impact on society.</p>
      
              <h3>2. I value people.</h3>
              <p>I hope that the design I do becomes a design where people can realize the value and dignity of a person. Also, I hope my design contributes to people's respect for each other.</p>
      
              <h3>3. I am responsive.</h3>
              <p>I want to be a designer who responds quickly to people's needs. When someone needs to solve their problem, I am willing to solve it with my design.</p>
